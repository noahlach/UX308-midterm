This February I was lucky enough to see Zhu perform at the legendary [Red Rocks Ampitheatre](https://www.redrocksonline.com) in Colorado. He played an incredible two-hour set with his signature live ensemble: an electric guitarist, a saxophone player, and his own voice. During the performance Zhu dropped a number of [unreleased tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvuEJ_Gi2ZU) and announced a new album coming out in 2020, promising "the most compelling Zhu project is yet to come."
